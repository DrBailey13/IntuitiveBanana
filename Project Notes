User Story: As a music enthusiast new or classic music is frustrating, 
            I want to cross reference videos, music and lyrics together to learn about 
                new musicians and all related content. 
            So that I can stay informed about trending or popular new music

            Given I am a music enthusiast
            When I search for new music, artists or lyrics
            Then I should receive content specific to my search 
                in a easily digestable format.

# IntuitiveBanana
First Project 

## Installation

No installation is necessary

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give the user an imersive music interaction; in that they can search artists, read music related news, find local concert and access tickets, and enjoy our fetured artists and songs. 

## Functionality

This page uses 3 different API's, Ticket Master, Audio DB and the New York Times to allow users to pull information about genre related news, fetured songs and artists, local concerts and search artist information by their name. Our three seperate API pulls allow us to offer a holistic user experience to music information.
